# RouteMaster

Handy routing controller for the truly excellent [nanohttpd](https://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd) tiny, easily embeddable HTTP Java server.

See [https://synapticloop.github.io/routemaster/](https://synapticloop.github.io/routemaster/) for full documentation

# Now with Templar templating!

Yes, you can now do some server side includes, using the synapticloop templar templating language!

## Options

Following the NanoHTTPD, you may pass in the following options

```
- h      
--host   The host to bind to - default 127.0.0.1

-p
--port   The port to bind to - default 5474

-d
--dir    The directory that the html files reside in

```

## As an aside

The name ```RouteMaster``` pays homage to the original London buses [(see the wikipedia entry)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routemaster) which would take you wherever you would like to go.

The favicon is also related, showing a depiction of the back top window of a routemaster bus.
