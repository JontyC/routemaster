<h3>Modules <em>(including handlers)</em></h3>

<p>
	Modules are an easy way to extend <code>routemaster</code> in a modular fashion 
	without having to compile and deploy everything together.
</p>

<p>
	In this way you may develop specific routes, features and handlers and package 
	them into small binaries that can then be distributed easily.
</p>

<h4>The routemaster (server edition)</h4>

<p>
	Routemaster now comes in a <code>server</code> edition which is the lightest-
	weight version and contains no registered:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>options</li>
	<li>handlers</li>
	<li>routes (RESTful or otherwise)</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Whilst this will still work as a web server, this will need to be extended by 
	using modules.
</p>

<p>
	The server version can be downloaded from the <a href="https://github.com/synapticloop/routemaster/releases">GitHub releases</a> 
	page.  The jar that you are looking for is the one with the <code>server</code> 
	classifier (e.g. <code>routemaster-2.1.0-server.jar</code>).
</p>

<h3>Setting up the server</h3>

<h4>Step 1: Download the jar file</h4>

<p>
	Download the jar file.
</p>

<h4>Step 2: create a modules directory</h4>

<p>
	In the same directory as the downloaded file (in fact it needs to be in the same 
	directory from which you run the routemaster server) create a directory named 
	<code>modules</code>.
</p>

<h4>Step 3: Use the modules</h4>

<p>
	In this directory - place any of the modules that you want to use.
</p>

<h4>Step 4: Start the server</h4>

<p>
	Start the server with the command (for example)
</p>

<pre><code>java -jar routemaster-2.1.0-server.jar</code></pre>

<p>
	The modules will then be loaded and registered for use
