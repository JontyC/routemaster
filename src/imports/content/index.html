<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
	RouteMaster a simple WebServer and router for Java.
</p>

<p>
	Routemaster is a library that can be included to extend nanoHTTPd with additional 
	functionality to include simple and RESTful routes.  In itself it is not runnable, 
	and requires at least the <code>org.nanohttpd:nanohttpd</code> library to be run.
</p>

<p>
	There is an example jar which includes a complete runnable which can be found 
	under the <code>routemaster-templar.jar</code> artefact in the 
	<a href="https://github.com/synapticloop/routemaster/releases/">github releases</a> 
	section.  This includes all components to run the server.
</p>

<p>
	There are two major ideas that the documentation relies on.
</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Servants</strong>, and</li>
	<li><strong>Handlers</strong>
</ol>

<h4>Servants</h4>

<p>
	Throughout this documentation we refer to the implementation classes as 
	<code>Servant</code>s - which either extend the <code>Routable</code>, or 
	<code>RestRoutable</code> abstract classes.
</p>

<p>
	All interfaces reside in the <code>synapticloop.nanohttpd.router</code> package.
</p>

<h4>Handlers</h4>

<p>
	Handlers allow you to extend the functionality of routemaster to provide additional 
	parsers for specific functionality.  Included within this package is the <code>templar</code> 
	handler <code>synapticloop.nanohttpd.handler.TemplarHandler</code>.  This can 
	be added to the configuration easily:
</p>

{pre
<pre><code># Now for some handlers - this is for the templar handle (bound to *.templar)

handler.templar=synapticloop.nanohttpd.handler.TemplarHandler
</code></pre>
pre}

<p>
	you probably want to have a look at the <a href="quick-start.html">quick start section</a> 
	to get up and running and understand the core framework.
</p>

<h4>Simple Router</h4>

<p>
	When you just need a simple router in java where you take care of all of the 
	details.  Just implement the 
	<code>synapticloop.nanohttpd.router.Routable</code> interface and over-ride 
	the method(s) that you want to respond to.
</p>

<h4>REST-ful Router</h4>

<p>
	When you just need a simple RESTful router in java, just implement the 
	<code>synapticloop.nanohttpd.router.RestRoutable</code> interface and over-ride 
	the method(s) that you want to respond to.
</p>

<h4>Static File Listing Serving</h4>

<p>
	When you just want to serve up a directory listing from the root directory, 
	there is a simple servant to do it for you.
</p>

<h4>Static File Serving</h4>

<p>
	When you just want to serve up static files from the file system, as simple 
	as that.
</p>

<h4>Classpath file serving</h4>

<p>
	When you are delivering a complete jar file and all the resources are within 
	the jar.
</p>

<h4>Caching Classpath file serving</h4>

<p>
	When you are delivering a complete jar file and all the resources are within 
	the jar, for each resource that is delivered, this will be placed in the cache 
	for speedier delivery to the client.
</p>

<p>
	This of course comes with the trade-off of memory usage versus speed.
