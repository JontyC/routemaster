RouteMaster
===========
Handy routing controller for the truly excellent [nanohttpd](https://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd) tiny, easily embeddable HTTP Java server.

## How do I use RouteMaster?

you will need the following:

  + java (6 or higher)
  + ant

then run

```
ant download-depandencies dist 
```

which will download all of the nanohttpd components and build the RouteMaster, and place it

You will need to create a ```routemaster.properties``` file which is required to be in the root of your classpath (e.g. src/main/java).  See ```routemaster.properties``` file for more information.

# This is a work in progress at the moment

## As an aside

The name ```RouteMaster``` pays homage to the original London buses [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routemaster) which would take you wherever you would like to go.

The favicon is also related, showing a depiction of the back top window of a routemaster bus.
